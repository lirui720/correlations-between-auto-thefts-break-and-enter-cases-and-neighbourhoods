Using a combination of three datasets retrieved from the Toronto Police Service and the City of Toronto Open Data portal: Auto Theft Open Data, Break & Enter Open Data, and Neighborhood Open Data. Using the crime datasets, we are investigating the correlations related to auto-theft cases. We will be primarily comparing auto theft data to break-and-enter cases and neighbourhood statistics. This will allow us to make present inferences, as well as future predictions of auto theft cases in Toronto. The five techniques that we will utilize for our analysis are technique-significant merging of data, feature engineering, predictive modelling, visualizing data for insight generation, and executive dashboarding.
